# Simple Dockerfile + Kubernetes examples

Covers simple packaging of apps using multi stage builds, and deploying these as pods and deployments with configuration.

See the golang-server and java-server directories. The golang server README.md is more detailed, and all YAML examples would apply to the
java server as well, once it is packaged as a docker image, just changing the image name and naming conventions.
